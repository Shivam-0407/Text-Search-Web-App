## Lessons Learned
This project is completely dependent on how one can use the idea of hooks provided by the React library. Two of the important hooks used in this project are - 

## useState() - 
The useState hook is a React feature that enables functional components to manage state. It allows developers to create and update state variables within functional components, thus facilitating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

## useRef() - 
The useRef hook is a React feature that provides a way to persist mutable values across component renders. It returns a mutable ref object whose .current property can hold a mutable value that persists between renders.
